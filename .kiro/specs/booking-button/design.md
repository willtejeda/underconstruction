# Design Document

## Overview

The booking button feature will be integrated into the existing Sound Shuttle Studios "coming soon" page as a prominent call-to-action element. The design leverages the current Preact/HTM architecture and Tailwind CSS styling system to create a cohesive, accessible, and visually appealing booking interface that encourages user engagement while maintaining the professional studio aesthetic.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
The booking button will be implemented as a Preact component within the existing App component structure:

```
App Component
├── Main Content Section
│   ├── Studio Title
│   ├── Description Text
│   └── BookingButton Component (NEW)
└── Footer Section
```

### Technology Integration
- **Framework**: Preact with HTM (existing)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom brand colors (existing)
- **Interaction**: Native browser navigation with `window.open()` for new tab behavior
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and semantic HTML

## Components and Interfaces

### BookingButton Component

**Props Interface:**
```javascript
{
  href: string,           // Booking URL
  text: string,           // Button text content
  className?: string,     // Additional CSS classes
  ariaLabel?: string      // Accessibility label
}
```

**Component Behavior:**
- Renders as a semantic `<a>` element with button styling
- Opens booking URL in new tab/window
- Provides hover and focus states
- Includes proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

### Visual Design Specifications

**Button Styling:**
- Background: Brand gold (#FBBF24) with gradient enhancement
- Text: Dark color for contrast (#000000 or #1F2937)
- Typography: Inter font family, bold weight (700)
- Padding: Generous padding for touch targets (py-4 px-8)
- Border radius: Rounded corners (rounded-lg)
- Shadow: Subtle drop shadow for depth

**Interactive States:**
- Hover: Slight scale transform and brightness increase
- Focus: Visible focus ring for keyboard navigation
- Active: Brief scale-down effect for tactile feedback

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Mobile: Full-width button with appropriate touch target size
- Desktop: Fixed-width centered button with hover effects

## Data Models

### Button Configuration
```javascript
const bookingConfig = {
  url: 'https://engineears.com/studio/soundshuttle/366?bookNow=true',
  text: 'Book Studio Time',
  ariaLabel: 'Book studio time at Sound Shuttle Studios - opens in new tab'
}
```

## Error Handling

### Navigation Failures
- **Fallback**: If `window.open()` fails, provide fallback to `window.location.href`
- **User Feedback**: Console logging for debugging purposes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Button remains functional even if JavaScript fails

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Screen Readers**: Clear ARIA labels and role attributes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Proper tab order and focus management
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure WCAG AA compliance for text/background contrast
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch target size for mobile devices

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Testing
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design testing across device sizes
- Brand consistency verification against existing design system

### Functional Testing
- Link navigation verification
- New tab/window opening behavior
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Touch interaction on mobile devices

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Color contrast validation
- ARIA attribute verification

### Integration Testing
- Preact component rendering
- Tailwind CSS class application
- Animation and transition effects
- Performance impact assessment

## Implementation Notes

### Positioning Strategy
The booking button will be positioned between the description text and the footer, creating a natural flow that guides users from learning about the studio to taking action.

### Animation Integration
The button will inherit the existing `animate-fade-in-down` animation to maintain visual consistency with the page load sequence.

### Performance Considerations
- No additional external dependencies required
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- CSS-only animations for smooth performance
- Optimized for Core Web Vitals metrics
